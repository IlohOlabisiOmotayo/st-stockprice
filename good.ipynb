His Pavlovian responses are so cute. like a little hamster - love it., “I could either watch it happen, or be part of it.” @elonmusk We are grateful for the entire @Tesla team and the support the community has for the mission, it’s success and beyond. Congratulations one last time on Q3! Now let’s do it again! 🎉🎊👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 https://t.co/Ni0aFWxd1t, In 2018, the year I got my first Tesla, there was 245,000 deliveries. \\n\\nNow Tesla is delivering that many cars every quarter. What an insane growth story to witness. @elonmusk $tsla, As Tesla blows out expectations, we see again analysts writing that valuation is justified only if Tesla goes beyond selling cars. That is nonsense. Just selling cars, $TSLA can be &gt;trillion market cap in 5-years… and much more with the rest., Proud to be Tesla Owner\\nProud to be $TSLA Owner, I found the perfect “@Tesla is essentially a busted growth story” graph for Gordy!\\nI cannot essentially find another argument for him to sell his ridiculous bear story tomorrow on @SquawkCNBC.\\n\\nSomebody please send it to him, I’m essentially blocked so I can’t do it 🤷🏼\\u200d♀️ https://t.co/ZGXpv5beeq, Tesla margin expansion this quarter will be significant, driven by:\\n\\n- Higher sales from Shanghai- driving operating leverage \\n- Higher mix of Model Y\\n- 9.2k Model S, mostly Plaid\\n- U.S. price increases in Q2-21 on Model 3/Y/S\\n\\nExpecting auto margins &gt;30%.\\n\\n$TSLA, Would you spend your $doge to buy a @Tesla? 🐕💰, Perhaps the best comp for 3Q delivs of 241.3K (+7.2% beat vs est 225K consensus) is 2021 1Q, when $TSLA delivered 184.8K vehicles vs 172K consensus (+7.4% beat). 1Q results were also released when the mkt was closed, on Good Friday 4/2., 2/ On the following Mon 4/5, $TSLA +4.4% vs NDX 100 +2.0%. By COB Friday 4/9, TSLA +2.3% cum vs NDX +3.9% as some traders sold. The next week, two analysts upgraded TSLA to buys; by Day 7, TSLA +15.2% vs +4.9% NDX. The same could happen here as TSLA’s narrative on China changes. https://t.co/n6923bHviV, Tomorrow, WS analysts will stand in front of their sales teams and explain why they were too low on 3Q $TSLA delivs (China), and raise EPS ests by ~10% for 2021 3Q, ~4% for FY’21, and ~4% for FY’22.

How you replace it and fix the problem!\\nYou need to breakdown entire car. \\nOn $NIO you fix it in 3 minutes!\\nAnd you can upgrade your battery when technology gets better. \\nNIO is great company., Texas will be the new tesla HQ. Fairly obvious. SpaceX probably too. Will save shareholders a ton of money over time. $TSLA, Live link to the full quality $TSLA deliveries animation on Flourish that you can pause, time scrub, resize, etc.:\\nhttps://t.co/9CqrEPnrZj, One thing I learned last week with @VivasVK7 - tesla is so far ahead of the “competition” it’s not competition. Tesla is innovating and moving so fast. No company in history has been so well positioned to change the future and profit from it. $tsla, NEWS: Tesla Amps Up Rivian $RIVN Poaching Fight, Cites Battery Secrets Theft\\n\\n“Now apparently under pressure from investors after nearly a dozen years without producing a single commercial vehicle, Rivian has intensified its unlawful efforts,” $TSLA said\\n\\nhttps://t.co/7yteBCtwrM, You’ll be able to buy a new Tesla with a single $TSLA share someday., I know someone who has been putting between $100 and $250 in $TSLA every month for past 2 years. She now has a $25k portfolio., When $TSLA was a $40B market cap I remember thinking WTF. This  company should be $500B to $1T.\\n\\nNow a $760B market cap and I think WTF. They should be at $5T-10T\\ndue to EV, solar and storage, AI, manufacturing, robotics.\\n\\nAnd as these mature further we’ll be talking  $20T- $50T, Out of 17 stocks I shorted over the last two months, this is the only stock I lost money on. I believe it is cornered by a fund that utilizes options market and I believe it is connected with ARK funds, like Archegos. If so, this will implode when $ARKK breaks that neckline $TSLA https://t.co/TpXdOiUuBm, Today I ordered my CyberTruck\\n\\nFigured if I don’t order soon I won’t get one until 2024 😆\\n\\n@Tesla @SawyerMerritt @WholeMarsBlog @elonmusk https://t.co/kD7GKLVm3j, Public Weekly Watchlist:\\n\\n$ROKU over 317, 320c\\n$TSLA over 800, 820c\\n$V over 233, 235c\\n$PENN over 81, 82c\\n$SNOW below 292, 290 | over 326, 330c\\n\\nCharts posted later today with an additional 2 #bonus picks\\n\\nGood luck, traders!, If $TSLA hits $5000 there will be a flood of Investor’s worth $10M or more. \\n\\nThat’s a big number. \\n\\nSo much can/will happen., @elonmusk should accept $Shib as a payment for @Tesla!💯💎🙌, Keep your eyes on EV sector tomorrow. $TSLA $800 break is the key.

You might contact some automotive journalists on YouTube so they can report on your problem. (The Fast Lane, Car Coach, Redline, Alex on Autos), $TSLA still under-owned by active mgrs bm’d to S&amp;P 500 ($9T AUM) where it’s a 1.7% wt. If PMs under-own TSLA by 1/2, that’s a $75B opportunity, or 12% of float. Blowout 3Q delivs could cause PMs to step up as China and semis concerns ease, but still looks expensive on P/E., Who’s ready for 🔥 tomorrow?! \\n\\n$TSLA #Tesla, I\\'m so bullish on Cybertruk. The market does not yet understand the significance of this product for Tesla. I expect CT to provide Giga Shanghai-like margins, and sell upwards of 500k/yr by 2024. Total potential market is ~800k/yr.\\n\\nNo other truck will deliver CT\\'s value.\\n\\n$TSLA, $TSLA bull case:\\nwhile the majority of the auto OEMs loose traction and had a significant sales decline in Q3/21. Tesla deliveries jumped to a new record high. Now that #GigaBerlin and #GigaAustin will start operation soon, sales numbers will explode. https://t.co/Z1C7tMON6g, If you adjust for risk, $TSLA may be a better investment now than it was when I first bought shares in 2013., He got his in 2017 and I got mine in 2018. I will never shift back to ICE car and my son is sure his first one will be a @Tesla Congratulations to the amazing accomplishments in Q3!

Watch if it can clear 800. https://t.co/biTEpsovVA, Electricity costs in Norway yesterday and today is 0.0012$ per kilowatt 🤯🇳🇴\\n\\nI can charge my Model 3 from 0-100% for only 0.09$ 🔋💰\\n\\nMassive winds and high level of water in magazines are some of the reason why. \\n\\n$TSLA / @Tesla / @elonmusk https://t.co/cbNM85h8P6, If Tesla were to offer 2 brand new colors on their cars what would you want to see? I wish @Tesla offered that matte black they showed during the Model 3 unveil 5.5 years ago. https://t.co/Ewn5A5zS58, @SawyerMerritt @Tesla Silver and navy blue. Matte paint is a pain to take care of and even more of a pain if it gets damaged. https://t.co/3Jqn4oDqWX, #Tesla accepting $DOGE happening soon! ⚠️🔥🚀                                                                           \\n\\n@elonmusk #Doge4Tesla                          @Tesla, 2/ The biggest challenge getting active managers bm’d to the S&amp;P 500 to own $TSLA is the P/E, which at 106x FY’22 Street EPS is 2-3x AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, FB. So while it’s a good exercise to est what % float active mgrs might buy at full weights, it’s unlikely to happen yet., 3/ $TSLA 3Q delivs should ease two big concerns of instit pms underweight TSLA:  \\n1/ The global chip shortage is not hurting $TSLA as it has every other auto mnfr;\\n2/ China demand is obviously not slowing, with record China Sept and 3Q domestic sales (Sept CPCA #s 10/9)., The people most likely to be right on Tesla’s future stock price are those who have been right all along. Those who can explain their reasoning at an engineering level, not just at a financial level.\\n\\nThis includes many long time $TSLA shareholders. Analysts are flying blind., I am so blown away by FSD Beta 10.1. It’s so great to use. \\n\\nThe sensation of just naming where you want to go and having your car take you there is incredible. I can’t wait for you all to try it, starting this week. @elonmusk $tsla, If you love $TSLA, $PLTR or $DOGE, I\\'ll follow you. Just let me know.👌, Bitches , being a $tsla stonk holder in 2013 was hard. Waking up in the middle of the night in panic because some headline dropped. Back then we didn’t know if $tslaq was full of shit. The only thing I knew was that the model s was incredible and this should work. @jasondebolt'"
